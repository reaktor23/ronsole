# ronsole - The Reaktor 23 Console

Setup using ansible for a raspberry pi with a touchscreen display attached in our room.

This is actually not limited to a raspberry pi.

You may need to provide a different hostname or ip address and pass `--ask-pass` and/or `--ask-become-pass` to make ansible connect to the raspberry.
